# Feature Specification: WindowManager (Dockable Windows) for GameBuilder2d

**Feature Branch**: `001-windowmanager-will-be`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "WindowManager will be a window manager for GameBuilder2d and it will be able to create Windows that can be also Docked."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a GameBuilder2d user, I can create application windows and organize them by docking (attaching) windows to areas or groups so that I can customize my workspace layout for different tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the application is running, When the user creates a new window with a specified title, Then the window appears as a floating window and is focusable.
2. Given a floating window is visible, When the user drags it to a valid dock area, Then it docks and resizes to occupy that area.
3. Given a docked window exists, When the user undocks it, Then it becomes a floating window retaining its content and state.
4. Given multiple windows are docked in the same region, When the user changes their order, Then the new order is reflected consistently.
5. Given multiple windows are docked in the same region, When the user selects a different tab in that region, Then that window becomes active and visible in the region.
6. Given the user resizes a docked region, When they drag the splitter, Then adjacent regions resize while preserving minimum region sizes (minimum width 200 and height 120 in logical units unless a window specifies a larger minimum).
7. Given the user closes a window, When they activate the close control, Then the window closes immediately and is removed from its dock/floating state without leaving empty artifacts.
8. Given the user has an arranged layout, When they exit and relaunch the application, Then the previous layout is automatically restored.
9. Given more tabs exist than fit in a docked region's header, When the user navigates the tabs, Then overflow navigation allows access to all windows without layout corruption.
10. Given the last session used multiple monitors and one is now disconnected, When the application starts, Then all windows appear on available displays (prefer primary) with layout preserved as closely as possible.

### Edge Cases
- Docking target is too small or screen space is limited ‚Üí window should snap to the nearest valid region or remain floating with clear feedback.
- User attempts to dock into a full region with size constraints ‚Üí system should indicate the constraint and prevent invalid placements.
- Many windows (e.g., 50+) ‚Üí interactions remain usable; tab headers provide overflow navigation (scroll or next/prev controls) without hiding access to any window.
- Minimum supported workspace resolution: 1280√ó720. On smaller viewports, essential controls remain accessible and overflow navigation appears as needed.
- Layout persistence: last-used layout is automatically saved on exit and restored on next launch.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create a new window with a title and optional initial size.
- **FR-002**: System MUST render new windows as floating by default, positioned within the visible workspace.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support docking windows to predefined regions of the workspace: left, right, top, bottom, and into the center of an existing region to join as a tab.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow undocking a docked window back to floating state without losing its state/content.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support grouping multiple windows within a single dock region using tabs; the active tab determines the visible window.
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable resizing of docked regions with interactive splitters while honoring minimum sizes (default minimum region size: width 200, height 120 in logical units; a window may specify a larger minimum which takes precedence).
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve focus behavior: only one window is active at a time; keyboard focus follows the active window.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear visual affordances for docking during drag operations (e.g., highlight valid targets and preview placement) and prevent invalid drops.
- **FR-009**: System MUST support closing windows via a standard control and remove them cleanly from the layout.
- **FR-010**: System MUST automatically remember and restore the last-used layout across sessions; users can disable automatic restore via a setting.
- **FR-011**: System MUST support keyboard-only actions to focus and cycle windows, dock/undock, and close windows; specific key mappings may be configurable and documented for users.
- **FR-012**: System SHOULD allow saving and loading named layouts for different workflows (at least 10 named layouts supported).
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle multi-monitor and varying DPI environments without layout corruption; if a display from the saved layout is unavailable, windows relocate to the primary display while preserving relative structure.
- **FR-014**: System MUST support at least 50 concurrent windows open without layout corruption; tabbed regions provide overflow navigation when tabs exceed available space.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Window**: A user-visible container with title and content area; has properties like title, visibility, focus state, and placement (floating or docked).
- **Dock Region**: A logical area where windows can be attached; supports ordering, resizing, and grouping of windows.
- **Layout**: A composition of windows and dock regions; is automatically saved on exit and restored on launch; users may also save and load named layouts.
