# Implementation Plan: WindowManager (Dockable Windows)

**Branch**: `001-windowmanager-will-be` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: C:\\Users\\nikme\\source\\repos\\GameBuilder2d\\specs\\001-windowmanager-will-be\\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-windowmanager-will-be/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (copilot)
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
WindowManager provides creation, docking, tabbing, resizing, closing, persistence, and keyboard navigation for windows in GameBuilder2d. Technical approach will leverage C++ with raylib for rendering and rlImGui for windowing/tab/docking UI paradigms.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: C++20 (project default)
**Primary Dependencies**: raylib (rendering), rlImGui (UI docking/tabs)
**Storage**: Local file persistence for layouts (JSON or similar)
**Testing**: Unit tests where feasible; manual integration validation via quickstart scenarios
**Target Platform**: Desktop (Windows, Linux via WSL)
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: Smooth interactions at 60 fps with 50 windows
**Constraints**: Minimum region size 200x120 logical units; minimum workspace 1280x720; multi-monitor/DPI robust
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 50 concurrent windows, multiple named layouts

## Constitution Check
- Core Principles in constitution are placeholders; applying pragmatic interpretations:
   - Test-First: Provide behavioral contracts and quickstart scenarios before implementation.
   - Simplicity: Single-project, no additional services.
   - Observability: Serializable layout and clear state transitions for debuggability.
   - Integration: Manual integration validation via quickstart.
   - Versioning/Breaking Changes: New feature isolated; no breaking changes to existing APIs expected.

**Structure Decision**: DEFAULT to Option 1

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Created research summary at `C:\Users\nikme\source\repos\GameBuilder2d\specs\001-windowmanager-will-be\research.md` with decisions, rationale, alternatives.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- Produced:
   - Data model: `C:\Users\nikme\source\repos\GameBuilder2d\specs\001-windowmanager-will-be\data-model.md`
   - Contracts: `C:\Users\nikme\source\repos\GameBuilder2d\specs\001-windowmanager-will-be\contracts\window-manager-contract.md`
   - Quickstart: `C:\Users\nikme\source\repos\GameBuilder2d\specs\001-windowmanager-will-be\quickstart.md`

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- See template section; will be executed by /tasks.

## Complexity Tracking
| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| UI quickstart scenarios instead of automated tests | Heavy UI interactions | Headless automation not readily available in project |

## Progress Tracking
**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
