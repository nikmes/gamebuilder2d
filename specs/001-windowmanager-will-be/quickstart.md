# Quickstart: Validate WindowManager Manually

1. Launch GameBuilder2d runtime.
2. Create three windows: "Scene", "Inspector", "Console".
3. Dock "Inspector" to the right; dock "Console" to the bottom.
4. Create a fourth window "Assets" and drop in the center of right region to tab with "Inspector".
5. Reorder tabs in the right region and verify active tab switches correctly.
6. Resize the splitter between main and right region; verify minima respected (>=200x120).
7. Close "Console"; ensure layout remains consistent and no artifacts remain.
8. Exit the app; relaunch and verify layout auto-restores.
9. Disconnect a secondary monitor if used; relaunch and verify windows appear on primary display.
