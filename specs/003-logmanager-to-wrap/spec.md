# Feature Specification: LogManager

**Feature Branch**: `003-logmanager-to-wrap`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "LogManager to wrap lwlog functionality"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want a simple `LogManager` that standardizes logging across the application so that I can log messages consistently without knowing `lwlog` details.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given the app starts, When `LogManager::init()` is called with default settings, Then an application-wide logger is available and logs appear on the console.
2. Given `LogManager` is initialized, When a component calls `LogManager::info("msg")`, Then the message is written using the configured pattern and level.
3. Given `LogManager` is initialized with a custom name/pattern, When any log method is called, Then the output respects the custom name/pattern.
4. Given `LogManager::shutdown()` is called, When new log calls are made, Then they are either no-ops or an initialization error is surfaced per policy.

### Edge Cases
- Initialization called multiple times: subsequent calls should be idempotent or update config per policy. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Logging before initialization: either queue-and-flush or explicit no-op with warning. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Thread safety: concurrent log calls from multiple threads should be safe. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Runtime reconfiguration (pattern/level): supported or limited to startup only? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST provide a `LogManager` facade to centralize logging usage across the app.
- FR-002: System MUST allow initialization with default values (logger name, pattern, minimum level) and optional customization.
- FR-003: System MUST expose simple helpers for common levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error, critical.
- FR-004: System MUST ensure calls are safe when `LogManager` is not initialized (defined behavior). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- FR-005: System MUST support retrieving the underlying logger object for advanced use-cases.
- FR-006: System MUST define a shutdown method that cleans up resources and prevents further logging or handles it gracefully.
- FR-007: System SHOULD integrate with console sink by default; future sinks (file, rotating) may be added later.
- FR-008: System SHOULD be easily swappable if the logging backend changes (keep consumers decoupled from `lwlog`).

### Key Entities
- LogManager: global singleton/facade that owns configuration and provides access to the logger.
- Logger: the conceptual logging endpoint (backed by `lwlog`), supporting name, pattern, and levels.
