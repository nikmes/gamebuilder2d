# Implementation Plan — Audio Manager Window

## Phase 0 · Alignment & Clarifications *(Not Started)*
- [ ] Confirm AudioManager APIs (snapshots, preview, events) are sufficient.
- [ ] Decide on preview UI (waveform, progress bar, controls).
- [ ] Approve layout: left asset list, right preview/config/diagnostics.

## Phase 1 · API Integration & Data Models
- Outline:
	- Integrate AudioManager snapshots for inventory.
	- Use preview APIs for playback control.
	- Subscribe to events for real-time updates.
- [ ] Define UI data models (AudioAssetItem, PreviewSession, etc.)
- [ ] Implement snapshot capture and event subscription.

## Phase 2 · UI Composition (ImGui)
- Outline:
	- Split-pane layout: asset list left, details right.
	- Asset list with play buttons, metadata columns.
	- Preview panel with controls, progress.
	- Config section for volumes/paths.
	- Diagnostics gauges and event log.
- [ ] Scaffold AudioManagerWindow and register with WindowManager.
- [ ] Implement asset list rendering.
- [ ] Add preview controls and progress display.
- [ ] Integrate config editing similar to ConfigurationManagerWindow.

## Phase 3 · State Management & Persistence
- [ ] Track dirty state for config changes.
- [ ] Implement apply/save for config updates.
- [ ] Manage preview sessions and cleanup.

## Phase 4 · Event Handling & Diagnostics
- [ ] Display real-time diagnostics.
- [ ] Log and filter audio events.

## Phase 5 · Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for UI state and API calls.
- [ ] Integration tests for preview and config changes.
- [ ] Manual QA for audio playback and UI responsiveness.</content>
