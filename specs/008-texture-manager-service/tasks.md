# Task Breakdown — TextureManager Service

## Clarifications & Preparations
- [x] Decide on placeholder texture asset (path, appearance)
- [x] Confirm canonical path / alias strategy
- [x] Define configuration keys in `config.json`

## Engineering
- [x] Create `TextureManager` service interface and implementation stubs
- [x] Hook service into existing service locator / bootstrap
- [x] Implement cache map with reference counting
- [x] Implement load-on-demand with configuration-driven parameters
- [x] Implement placeholder return on failure and log errors
- [x] Implement `release`, `forceUnload`, and `reloadAll`
- [x] Expose read-only metrics API (count, memory estimate)

## Integration
- [x] Replace direct Raylib load calls in editor UI (pilot: GameWindow)
- [ ] Replace direct load calls in fullscreen session / gameplay code paths
- [ ] Update configuration defaults and migration notes

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests (load, cache hit, release to zero, force unload, reload failure)
- [ ] Integration smoke test (request → render → reload)
- [ ] Performance sanity (measure synchronous load cost for representative textures)

## Documentation & Handoff
- [x] Add developer guide / README section for TextureManager usage
	- [x] Document initialization flow and required configuration keys
	- [x] Provide acquire/release usage examples (editor + gameplay)
	- [x] Note placeholder behavior, metrics, and reload guidance
- [x] Update changelog / release notes
- [x] Capture future enhancements (async loading, hot reload, LRU, compression)
