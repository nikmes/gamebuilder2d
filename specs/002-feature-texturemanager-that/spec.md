# Feature Specification: TextureManager for Image Management

**Feature Branch**: `002-feature-texturemanager-that`  
**Created**: September 20, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "TextureManager that will load and unload image files and manage them in memory. I will call the TextureManager to get textures already loaded in memory and if not found in memory there should be an attempt to load them."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user (developer or system) requests a texture by name or path. If the texture is already loaded in memory, it is returned immediately. If not, the system attempts to load the image file into memory and returns the loaded texture. The user can also request to unload textures to free memory.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a texture file exists and is not loaded, **When** the user requests it, **Then** the system loads the file into memory and returns the texture.
2. **Given** a texture is already loaded in memory, **When** the user requests it, **Then** the system returns the existing texture without reloading.
3. **Given** a texture is loaded, **When** the user requests to unload it, **Then** the system removes it from memory.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a requested image file does not exist or cannot be loaded? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error handling for missing/corrupt files]
- How does the system handle requests to unload textures that are not loaded?
- What are the memory limits or policies for texture management? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory management constraints]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to request textures by name or path.
- **FR-002**: System MUST return textures already loaded in memory without reloading.
- **FR-003**: System MUST attempt to load textures from image files if not found in memory.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to unload textures from memory.
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle errors when image files cannot be loaded. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error reporting mechanism]
- **FR-006**: System MUST manage memory usage for loaded textures. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: memory management policy]

### Key Entities
- **Texture**: Represents an image loaded into memory, identified by name or path, with attributes such as size, format, and status (loaded/unloaded).
- **TextureManager**: Manages the collection of loaded textures, provides methods to load, retrieve, and unload textures, and enforces memory policies.
