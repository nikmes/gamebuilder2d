# Implementation Plan: ConfigurationManager

**Branch**: `004-configurationmanager-to-handle` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: specs/004-configurationmanager-to-handle/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-configurationmanager-to-handle/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → OK: spec found and parsed
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → No outstanding markers; decisions documented in spec
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → PASS (no explicit constraints; default principles apply)
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → Completed below (format, path strategy, atomic writes rationale)
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
   → Completed below
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → PASS (post-design)
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (no tasks.md creation)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
Provide a centralized ConfigurationManager that loads JSON config from a per-user path, exposes typed accessors, supports atomic saves, environment overrides (`GB2D_`), and forward-compatible versioning with migrations and backups.

## Technical Context
- **Language/Version**: C++20
- **Primary Dependencies**: N/A (JSON library TBD if needed) 
- **Storage**: JSON file in per-user config directory (platform-specific)
- **Testing**: CTest + Catch2 unit tests
- **Target Platform**: Windows (primary), Linux/macOS (path rules defined)
- **Project Type**: single
- **Performance Goals**: Load/save config under 50ms for typical sizes (<1MB)
- **Constraints**: Atomic write; thread-safe reads; serialized writes; callbacks must be fast
- **Scale/Scope**: Single desktop app configuration

## Constitution Check
- Principles are placeholders; default guardrails apply:
  - Test-first encouraged → plan includes CTest/Catch2
  - Simplicity → JSON + file persistence, no DB
  - Observability → log warnings on fallback/override/migration

## Project Structure
As per template. No additional subprojects needed.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Decision: JSON format
  - Rationale: human-readable, ubiquitous tooling, simple typed accessors
  - Alternatives: INI (limited types), TOML/YAML (heavier); JSON chosen for simplicity
- Decision: Per-user path rules (Win/AppData, Linux/XDG, macOS/Library)
  - Rationale: Matches OS conventions; avoids permission issues
  - Alternatives: alongside binary (portable mode) – defer
- Decision: Atomic save (temp + replace)
  - Rationale: Prevent corruption on crash
  - Alternatives: direct write – rejected due to risk
- Decision: Version field + forward migration
  - Rationale: future-proofing; safe roll-forward
- Decision: Env var overrides (`GB2D_` prefix)
  - Rationale: simple dev/ops control without CLI parsing

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- data-model.md: key-value schema with supported types, version field, sample defaults
- contracts/: public API surface for `ConfigurationManager` (header-level contract)
- quickstart.md: initializing, reading/writing values, observing changes, understanding overrides

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
- TDD order: unit tests for defaults, load, save, overrides, migration → implement
- Parallel: path-resolution and JSON-IO can be developed independently [P]
- Integration: basic end-to-end check using a temp directory

## Complexity Tracking
None.
