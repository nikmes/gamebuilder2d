# Feature Specification: ConfigurationManager

**Feature Branch**: `004-configurationmanager-to-handle`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "ConfigurationManager to handle globaly our configuration and persist it."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want a `ConfigurationManager` that provides a single place to read and write application configuration so that settings are consistent across runs and easy to manage.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given no prior config exists, When the app calls `ConfigurationManager::loadOrDefault()`, Then defaults are loaded into memory and saved to a persistent location on first write.
2. Given a valid config file exists, When `ConfigurationManager::load()` is called, Then current settings reflect the fileâ€™s values.
3. Given changes are applied via `ConfigurationManager::set(key, value)`, When `ConfigurationManager::save()` is called, Then values persist and are reloaded on next start.
4. Given invalid or corrupted config on disk, When `load()` is called, Then the system falls back to defaults and signals a recoverable warning.
5. Given concurrent reads, When multiple components access configuration, Then reads are thread-safe and consistent. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Edge Cases
- Missing write permissions at target path: configuration should remain in-memory and user should be notified. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Partial writes (app crash during save): system should avoid corrupting existing config (atomic write). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Versioning/migrations when schema changes across releases. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Large config values or binary data storage not supported; validate and reject. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: System MUST provide a central `ConfigurationManager` to read/write application settings.
- FR-002: System MUST support default configuration when no persisted state exists.
- FR-003: System MUST load configuration from a persistent store at startup and allow save during runtime.
- FR-004: System MUST expose typed accessors (e.g., string, number, boolean) and reject unsupported types. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- FR-005: System MUST validate configuration and safely handle invalid/corrupt files (fallback + warning).
- FR-006: System MUST define the persistence location and format. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: file format (JSON/TOML/YAML/INI)? path (per-user appdata vs. alongside binary)?]
- FR-007: System SHOULD support atomic save to avoid corruption (write temp, then replace). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- FR-008: System SHOULD provide change notification callbacks to interested components. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- FR-009: System SHOULD support environment overrides and/or command-line overrides. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- FR-010: System SHOULD support versioning and migrations for schema changes. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Key Entities
- ConfigurationManager: facade owning in-memory settings, load/save, and default provisioning.
- Configuration Store: persistent representation (file on disk, path rules, format, and versioning policy).
